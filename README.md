# Predictive Maintenence of Engines

This predictive maintenance solution of ours focuses on the techniques used to predict when an in-service machine will fail, so that maintenance can be planned.Â The solution includes a usage of pre-configured machine learning algorithms, as well as custom python scripts(Notebooks), to enable an end-to-end solution from data processing to deploying of the machine learning model.
